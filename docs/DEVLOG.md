# bc-tagger dev log

Short notes on what changed, why, and how to run it. The full decisions and API shapes live in
`/Users/alvaroh/Projects/auto-rekordbox/LOCAL_COLLECTION_PLAN.md` (each session's Status section).

## Server (`server/`, branch `claude/rekordbox-backend-354716`)

### How to run

```bash
cd server && ./bct serve --port 8765           # the app's server (default data dir)
cd server && ./bct --data-dir /tmp/dev serve --port 8770   # a throwaway dev server with its own data
cd server && /Users/alvaroh/Projects/auto-rekordbox/.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q
```

Tests never touch Bandcamp, the music drive or a real rekordbox library: Bandcamp answers come from
`server/tests/fixtures/` (`BC_TAGGER_BANDCAMP_FIXTURES`), downloads from the stub
`server/tests/fixtures/stub_downloader.py` (`BC_TAGGER_DOWNLOADER_STUB`), and exports go to throwaway copies of
`rekordbox_test`.

### 2026-10-26

- **Imports (Phase 3):** `bc-tagger-import/1` batches. Lookups go to the collection first, then the file's
  Bandcamp URL, then Bandcamp's autocomplete. They're paced (1 request/s by default) with an honest
  User-Agent, and stop on Bandcamp's bot check. Then tag mapping, review, and commit (pending adds for the
  extension, tag merges, the `other` collection). Why: the user's hand-written track lists, imported without
  retyping.
- **Downloads (Phase 4):** Download an owned release that isn't located. It uses the user's
  `bandcamp-collection-downloader` with an exact `--item-id` (branch `bc-tagger-item-id` of that repo), into
  `downloads_dir`, then locates it.
- **Phase 5 (while the user was away):**
  - Writes onto an unplugged drive are refused ("music drive not mounted"), so `/Volumes/<name>` is never
    created on the internal disk.
  - "Look up in my browser": the extension runs the lookups the server hands it.
  - MusicBrainz as an optional lookup source.
  - Re-locate and pick a file by hand.
  - An opt-in file watcher, off by default.
  - An API end-to-end check on copies: import → one real download into `test-downloads/` → locate → export
    to a sandbox copy of `rekordbox_test`.
- **Phase 6:**
  - `modified_at` on items (import commits, merges, tag edits, sync), sortable, with undated items earliest
    (`/api/items?sort=modified_at`).
  - The commit result lists the added and merged ids, so the collection page can select exactly them.
  - Checked on a copy: sorted by Modified, the newest 20 items were exactly the commit's selection. Exporting
    that selection to a sandbox `rekordbox_test` (Elhwah merged with a new tag → added to
    `/bc-tagger/ritual`) gave 16 entries, 5 new playlists and no errors.
